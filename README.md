# FuryRacers
This repository contains the project files and code for the game FuryRacers. The game is originally made to work in unison with [this](https://github.com/s111/gamesystem) game server.
However, it is recommended to set up the compiled game, like showed in [this](https://github.com/fredrikzkl/FuryRacersCompiled) repository. 
The example repository contains a modified hub.js file, necessary to run the game. 
It also contains a modified .exe file, enabling direct launch of FuryRacers.

##Compiled Game
The [link](https://github.com/fredrikzkl/FuryRacersCompiled/archive/master.zip) to the compiled FuryRacers.

Unpack and start the exe file. Enjoy.

##Make custom maps

Follow appendix A in [this](https://github.com/fredrikzkl/FuryRacers/blob/master/Vedlegg%20A.pdf) document. 

##Important Notes

Remember to terminate all programs that may use port 3001. 

The compiled version is 64-bit, hence requiring a 64-bit windows system.

Controllers may be unstable on Apple iOS devices.
